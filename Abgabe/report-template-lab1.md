# My super duper awesome fancy game
In a world where colours are evil, you have to try and disguise yourself as one of them to survive. But Beware! 
You will only fit in with the colour you are disguised with, for colours are not befriended amongst each others.
Also you die when you fall out of the screen.
Basically a 2D sidescroller flappy bird with colour obstacles.

## Controls
- jump by repeatedly pressing space or w
- drop faster by pressing s

## Gameplay Features
- 2D sidescroller
- jumping
- endless spwaning of coloured obstacles with wating time inbetween
- changing colour after each obstacle
- start and restart screen (with brighter start/restart buttons, so its less tempting to push the exit buttons)

## Technical Features (Unity and other)
- obstacles spawn in different distances from each other
- a Moon? in the background where light passes by
- dying when dropping out of the screen or touching wrong colour
- start/restart & exit buttons


## Time Spent report
I spent quite some time figuring out what kind of game to make by browsing around and looking at tutorials.
for most of the parts i thought it would be possible way faster than it actually took me in the end.

getting ideas & watching tutorials: 3hours
making player: 5mins
player jumps: 5mins
background(moon? + light): 10mins
light moves around moon: 15mins
making coloured obstacle: 1hours
player interacts with coloured obstacles: 1.5hours
coloured obstacles spawn once with speed: 1hour
coloured objects spawn endless with wating time inbetween: 30min
adjusting (speed of obstacles, jump of player, spawntime of obstacles): 30mins
start/restart screen: 20mins
get start/restart & exit buttons to work: 1hour
trying to get audio to work: 30mins
9h 55mins

## Problems and Challenges
I was trying to create the obstacles within unity, but i could only figure out how to make them as plains, which are a 3D object, so they couldn't interact with my player
which is a 2D object. So i just made some coloured rectangles in photoshop. 
Couldn't get the Audio to work in time.
